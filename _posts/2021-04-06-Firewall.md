Firewall term comes in a picture when a security of an organization is at stacke. Basic functionality of a firewall is to protect your device or a network. Mainly, firewall exist in your topology in two ways; one is "Software", and another is "Hardware". Software is also known as host based firewall and Hardware known as network base firewall. Every organization prefer their own way of choosing firewall. Large organization prefer to have both firewalls but on the other hand small or medium size business select to have either one of this. Ther are many vendors like Cisco, FortiClient, Checkpoint, and PaloAltowhich. Network firewall always reside at the gate of your network so that it can protect your private network from the public internet. Host based firewall protect in the Operating system and protect it from the outer threats.

Firewall works based on different rules; rules can based on port, permission, service name and other. You can allow or deny the traffic over the network or the system. Additionally you can provide password to each firewall system to limit the access of the security system. Each firewall system can be configured in different ways.

1. **Inbound Rules/Outbound Rules**: Inbound rules always apply to incoming traffic and outbound rules always imply to outgoing traffic. For example, if user tries to connect web server in you network you have to create Inbound rule and if you are trying to make connection amd traffic flows out of the network then create outbound rule.
2. **New Rule**: New rule type can be based on various entities like Program, Port,  Predefine, and Custom. Action can be allow or deny connection. New rule does apply to Domain, private, or Public profile. Windows gives functionality to provide customize name and description. later on we can modify rules based on the user requirements, i.e.: service based on ICMP port, we can add or remove IP addresses to follow that rule.
3. **Filters**: User can filter traffic based on three categories like Profile, State, and Group. Filter by profile has three options Domain Profile, Private Profile and Public Profile. filter by State has two options as Enable and Disable. Filter by Group has several options, based on it you can apply filters.
4. **Action**: It has two options "Allow" and "Block". When rule is Allow, traffic from or to that service or destination has permission to enter or leave the network but on the contradictory side if rule is Block then it will be vice versa.
